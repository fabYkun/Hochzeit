Blind test webapp using Angular, a NodeJS server and WebSockets. 

The game master creates a room and set a list of musics that will be played. Users register to the room and compete by "buzzing" and telling the author what song is played. The game master gives the buzzing player points and the game continues...

Easy setup by running the application (node ./appFolder/app.js) on a computer and sharing its network with a router if necessary. Users access the app by going to the computer's IP combined with the correct port number.
